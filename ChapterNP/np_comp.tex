\section{What are NP-Complete Problems?}
\lettrine[lines=4]{N}{P-Complete} is a way of classifying the complexity of a problem in terms of how "long" it takes to run. The set of problems that are NP-Complete is the intersection of the set of problems that are NP and the set of problems that are NP-Hard, as shown below.
