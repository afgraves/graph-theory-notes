\chapter{Planarity and more}
\section{The Plane}
\lettrine[lines=4]{T}{he} Plane, is simply two-dimensional space. You may also see it refered to as $\mathbb{R}^2$ or the Euclidean Plane.
\subsection{Plane and Simple}
A graph is \textbf{planar} if it can be embedded in the plane without without any edges crossing.\newline
A \textbf{plane graph} is a graph that has been drawn without any edges crossing.\newline

\section{Don't cross me}
The \textbf{Crossing Number} of a graph G, denoted "cr(G)", is the smallest number of edge crossings needed to draw the graph in the plane.\newline
All planar graphs have a crossing number of 0. In the figure below, you can see that both $K_5$ and $K_{3,3}$ have crossing numbers of 1. (there isn't a figure yet get \textit{allll} the way off my back about it)
